# CS677_final_Project
# Machine Learning Interpretability/Explanability
## The final project for CS677(Machine Learning) class of MS in Data Science 

In this project a typical Classification Machine Learning task was solved using the following Machine Learning models:
- Logistic Regression (LR)
- Decision Tree (DT)
- Random Forest (RF)
- XGBoost (XGB)

The dataset: "Heart failure clinical records Data Set" from the UCI (University California Irvine) Machine Learning Repository

Interpretation was performed by 'eli5', LIME and  SHAP librarys
